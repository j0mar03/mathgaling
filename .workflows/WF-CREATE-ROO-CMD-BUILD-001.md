# Workflow: Create Roo Commander Build Archive

## 1. Objective 🎯
*   To create a standardized, versioned zip archive (`.zip`) containing the necessary Roo Commander configuration files for distribution.
*   To ensure the archive follows the defined versioning and naming conventions.
*   To place the archive in the designated `.builds/` directory.
*   To maintain a log of created builds in `.builds/README.md`.

## 2. Scope ↔️
*   This workflow is triggered manually when a new distributable build of the Roo Commander configuration is needed.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Initiates the workflow, determines version information, gathers changelog details (potentially delegating), executes the build process, verifies the output, and updates the build log.
*   **Executor (Terminal):** Runs the build script or commands provided by the Coordinator.
*   **Technical Writer (Optional):** Can be delegated the task of creating or updating the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 4. Preconditions🚦
*   The `.builds/` directory exists.
*   The `.builds/README.md` file exists (or will be created on the first run).
*   The `.docs/standards/roo-commander-version-naming-convention.md` document exists and is up-to-date.
*   A mechanism (ideally a script like `create_build.sh` or `create_build.js`) exists to perform the archiving, including file selection/exclusion.
*   Necessary tools (e.g., `zip` command-line utility, Node.js if using a JS script) are available in the environment.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
*   `.builds/README.md`: Log file for build history.
*   `.docs/standards/roo-commander-version-naming-convention.md`: Defines version numbers and codenames.
*   `create_build.[sh|js]` (Hypothetical): The script automating the build process.
*   `CHANGELOG.md` (Template/Previous Version): Used as a basis for the new changelog.
*   `README.dist.md` (Hypothetical Template): Template for the `README.md` to be included *inside* the zip.
*   `execute_command`: Tool to run the build script/commands.
*   `read_file`: Tool to read version info, changelogs, build logs.
*   `write_to_file`: Tool to create/update build log, potentially the distribution README/CHANGELOG if not scripted.
*   `append_to_file`: Tool to add entries to the build log.
*   `list_files`: Tool to verify script existence or build output.
*   `technical-writer` (Mode): Optional delegate for `CHANGELOG.md` creation/update.

## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜

*   **Step 1: Determine Build Version & Codename (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Identify the correct version number (e.g., `v7.01`) and codename (e.g., `Wallaby`) for the new build.
    *   **Inputs:** `.docs/standards/roo-commander-version-naming-convention.md`, potentially `.builds/README.md` to find the last version.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Read `.docs/standards/roo-commander-version-naming-convention.md` to confirm the current major version's codename.
        2.  Read `.builds/README.md` (if it exists) to determine the last build number for the current major version.
        3.  Increment the minor version number (e.g., v7.00 -> v7.01).
        4.  Construct the full version string (e.g., `v7.01`) and the archive filename stem (e.g., `roo-commander-v7.01-Wallaby`).
    *   **Outputs:** `BUILD_VERSION` (e.g., "v7.01"), `BUILD_CODENAME` (e.g., "Wallaby"), `ARCHIVE_NAME_STEM` (e.g., "roo-commander-v7.01-Wallaby").

*   **Step 2: Prepare CHANGELOG (Coordinator Task / Optional Delegation)**
    *   **Description:** Create or update a `CHANGELOG.md` file detailing changes for this specific build version.
    *   **Inputs:** `BUILD_VERSION`, knowledge of recent changes, previous `CHANGELOG.md` (if available).
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   **Option A (Manual/Coordinator):** Gather notes on changes since the last build. Format them into a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md` under the `BUILD_VERSION` heading. Use `write_to_file` to create/update a temporary changelog file (e.g., `.tmp/CHANGELOG.md`).
        *   **Option B (Delegate):** Delegate to `technical-writer` via `new_task`: "Create/Update CHANGELOG.md for build [BUILD_VERSION]. Summarize recent changes [provide details or pointers]. Save output to `.tmp/CHANGELOG.md`." Await completion.
    *   **Outputs:** A `CHANGELOG.md` file ready for inclusion in the build (e.g., located at `.tmp/CHANGELOG.md`).

*   **Step 3: Prepare Distribution README (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the `README.md` file intended for *inside* the zip archive is ready.
    *   **Inputs:** Template for the distribution README (e.g., `README.dist.md`), `BUILD_VERSION`, `BUILD_CODENAME`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Read the template content.
        2.  Update any placeholders (like version number, date).
        3.  Use `write_to_file` to save the finalized content to a temporary location (e.g., `.tmp/README.md`).
    *   **Outputs:** A `README.md` file ready for inclusion in the build (e.g., located at `.tmp/README.md`).

*   **Step 4: Execute Build Process (Coordinator delegates to Executor via `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Run the automated script or series of commands to create the zip archive.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Command to run the build script (e.g., `bash create_build.sh ${ARCHIVE_NAME_STEM} .tmp/README.md .tmp/CHANGELOG.md`) OR a series of `mkdir`, `cp`, `zip` commands.
        *   The script/commands must handle:
            *   Creating a temporary staging directory.
            *   Copying required files/folders (e.g., `.modes`, `.processes`, `.roo`, `.templates`, `.workflows`, `build_*.js`, `LICENSE`, `.roomodes`).
            *   Creating required empty directories (e.g., `.archive`, `.context`, etc.).
            *   Copying the prepared `.tmp/README.md` and `.tmp/CHANGELOG.md` into the staging directory.
            *   Creating the zip archive from the staging directory with the name `${ARCHIVE_NAME_STEM}.zip` and placing it in the `.builds/` directory.
            *   Cleaning up the temporary staging directory and `.tmp` files.
    *   **Instructions for Executor:** Execute the provided command(s).
    *   **Expected Output from Executor:** Terminal output indicating success or failure, exit code.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Execution):** Review output and exit code.
    *   **Validation/QA:** Check for success messages, non-zero exit code. Use `list_files` on `.builds/` to confirm the zip file exists with the correct name.
    *   **Error Handling:** If errors occur, analyze script/command output. Check file paths, permissions, tool availability (`zip`). Report failure or attempt troubleshooting.

*   **Step 5: Update Build Log (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Add an entry for the newly created build to the `.builds/README.md` log file.
    *   **Inputs:** `BUILD_VERSION`, `BUILD_CODENAME`, Current Date, `ARCHIVE_NAME_STEM`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Get the current date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
        2.  Format the log entry (e.g., `- **${BUILD_VERSION} (${BUILD_CODENAME})** - ${YYYY-MM-DD} - File: \`${ARCHIVE_NAME_STEM}.zip\``).
        3.  Use `append_to_file` to add the new entry to `.builds/README.md`. If the file doesn't exist, use `write_to_file` to create it with a header and the first entry.
    *   **Outputs:** Updated `.builds/README.md`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If writing/appending fails, report the error.

## 7. Postconditions ✅
*   A correctly named and structured zip archive exists in `.builds/`.
*   The `.builds/README.md` file contains an entry for the new build.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
*   If the build script fails, debug the script.
*   If file operations fail, check permissions and paths.
*   If versioning information is inconsistent, review `.builds/README.md` and the versioning standard document.
*   Escalate to the user if the build cannot be completed successfully.

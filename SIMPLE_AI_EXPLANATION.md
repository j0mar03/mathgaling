# MathGaling AI Algorithm - Simple Explanation
## For Academic Adviser Understanding

> **The Problem**: How do we know if a student really understands math?  
> **The Solution**: Use AI to track what students know and adapt to their learning

---

## What the AI Does (In Simple Terms)

The MathGaling system uses **2 AI techniques** working together:

1. **üß† Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)** = Probability calculator that estimates "How likely is it that the student knows this topic?"
2. **üîÄ Fuzzy Logic** = Context analyzer that considers "How did the student answer?" (fast/slow, hints used, etc.)

---

## Part 1: BKT Parameters (Research-Backed)

### **What BKT Tracks**
```
For each student + each math topic = One probability number (0% to 100%)
Example: "Juan knows Place Value with 67% confidence"
```

### **Four Research-Based Parameters**

| Parameter | Value | What It Means | Research Source |
|-----------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **pL0** | 30% | Starting knowledge when student begins | Corbett & Anderson (1995) |
| **pT** | 9% | How much student learns per practice | Yudelson et al. (2013) |
| **pS** | 10% | Chance of careless mistake when knowing | BKT Standard: < 10% |
| **pG** | 20% | Chance of lucky guess when not knowing | BKT Standard: < 30% |

### **Why These Values Work**
- **30% starting knowledge**: Grade 3 students have some basic number sense
- **9% learning rate**: Elementary math concepts need multiple practice sessions
- **10% slip rate**: Students sometimes make careless errors
- **20% guess rate**: Multiple choice gives some chance of lucky answers

## Part 2: Fuzzy Logic Parameters (Research-Backed)

### **What Fuzzy Logic Analyzes**
```
Not just "right or wrong" - but HOW the student answered:
‚Ä¢ How fast? (Response time)
‚Ä¢ Did they need help? (Hints used)
‚Ä¢ How many tries? (Attempts)
```

### **Research-Based Thresholds**

| Factor | Categories | Research Source |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Response Time** | Fast: <10s, Normal: 10-30s, Slow: >30s | Wise & Ma (2012) - 728,923 students |
| **Hints Used** | None: 0, Few: 1-2, Many: 3-4, Too Many: 5+ | Roll et al. (2017) - Help-seeking research |
| **Adjustments** | Range: -15% to +15% | Sweller et al. (2019) - Cognitive load theory |

### **Why These Values Work**
- **10 seconds**: Working memory limit research (Sweller, 2019)
- **Hint categories**: Based on help-seeking behavior studies
- **Small adjustments**: Prevent wild swings in knowledge estimates

## How They Work Together (Simple Example)

### **Student: Maria learning "Place Value"**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üìù Question: Value of 7 in 3,754?] --> B[‚úÖ Maria answers: 700]
    B --> C[üìä Collect Data]
    
    C --> D[‚è±Ô∏è Time: 8 seconds<br/>üí° Hints: 0<br/>üîÑ Attempts: 1<br/>‚úÖ Correct: Yes]
    
    D --> E[üß† BKT Calculation]
    E --> F[üìà Before: 45%<br/>After: 62%]
    
    F --> G[üîÄ Fuzzy Analysis]
    G --> H[üöÄ Fast + Correct + No Hints<br/>= Strong Evidence<br/>Bonus: +5%]
    
    H --> I[üéØ Final Result: 67%]
    I --> J[‚ùå 67% < 95% needed<br/>Continue Practice]
```

### **Step-by-Step Calculation**

#### **Step 1: BKT Calculation**
```
Maria's current knowledge: 45%
She answers correctly and quickly

BKT Formula (simplified):
New knowledge = Old knowledge + Learning boost - Error penalty
New knowledge = 45% + 17% = 62%
```

#### **Step 2: Fuzzy Logic Enhancement**
```
Context analysis:
‚Ä¢ Fast response (8 seconds) = Strong confidence
‚Ä¢ No hints used = Independent work  
‚Ä¢ Single attempt = Clear understanding

Fuzzy adjustment: +5% bonus
```

#### **Step 3: Final Decision**
```
Final knowledge estimate: 62% + 5% = 67%
System decision: 67% < 95% required ‚Üí Continue practice
Next question: Same difficulty level
```

## How Student Learning Progresses

### **Learning Journey Example: Pedro (Grade 3)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    START[üë¶ Pedro starts Place Value] --> Q1[Question 1: Easy]
    Q1 --> R1[Wrong answer, slow, many hints<br/>Knowledge: 30% ‚Üí 25%]
    R1 --> Q2[Question 2: Easier]
    Q2 --> R2[Correct answer, normal speed<br/>Knowledge: 25% ‚Üí 35%]
    R2 --> Q3[Question 3: Same level]
    Q3 --> R3[Correct, faster, fewer hints<br/>Knowledge: 35% ‚Üí 48%]
    R3 --> Q4[Question 4: Slightly harder]
    Q4 --> R4[Correct, fast, no hints<br/>Knowledge: 48% ‚Üí 65%]
    R4 --> CONTINUE[Continue until 95% mastery]
    CONTINUE --> NEXT_TOPIC[üéâ Move to next math topic]
```

### **What Makes This Intelligent**

#### **Traditional System:**
```
Question 1: Wrong (0%)
Question 2: Right (100%)  
Question 3: Right (100%)
Average: 67% ‚Üí Continue same level
```

#### **MathGaling AI System:**
```
Question 1: Wrong + Slow + Many hints ‚Üí 25% knowledge
Question 2: Right + Normal + Some hints ‚Üí 35% knowledge
Question 3: Right + Fast + No hints ‚Üí 65% knowledge
AI Decision: Student is improving, gradually increase difficulty
```

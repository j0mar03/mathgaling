## How the AI Algorithm Works

The MathGaling system uses **two integrated AI techniques** to track student learning:

1. **🧠 Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)** - Probabilistic model for knowledge estimation
2. **🔀 Fuzzy Logic Enhancement** - Context-aware adjustments based on student behavior

## Detailed Working Example with Real Numbers

### **Scenario**: Juan (Grade 3) learning "Place Value" topic

#### **Question 1: "What is the value of 7 in 3,754?"**

**📊 Student Response:**
- ✅ **Answer**: "700" (Correct)
- ⏱️ **Time**: 8 seconds (Fast)
- 💡 **Hints**: 0 (None)
- 🔄 **Attempts**: 1 (Single)

**🧠 BKT Calculation:**
```
Initial Knowledge: P(knows) = 0.30 (30%)
Parameters: slip=0.1, guess=0.2, learn_rate=0.09

Evidence Update (Correct Answer):
P(knows|correct) = 0.30 × (1-0.1) / [0.30 × (1-0.1) + (1-0.30) × 0.2]
P(knows|correct) = 0.30 × 0.9 / [0.27 + 0.14] = 0.27 / 0.41 = 0.66

Learning Update:
P(knows_final) = 0.66 + (1-0.66) × 0.09 = 0.66 + 0.03 = 0.69
```

**🔀 Fuzzy Logic Enhancement:**
```
Rule: Fast + Correct + No Hints → Strong Positive (+0.05)
Adjustment: +0.05
```

**📊 Final Result:**
```
Final Mastery = 0.69 + 0.05 = 0.74 (74%)
```

#### **Question 2: "Write 6,832 in words"**

**📊 Student Response:**
- ❌ **Answer**: "Six thousand eight hundred thirty-two" (Wrong - missing "and")
- ⏱️ **Time**: 45 seconds (Slow)
- 💡 **Hints**: 2 (Many)
- 🔄 **Attempts**: 2 (Multiple)

**🧠 BKT Calculation:**
```
Current Knowledge: P(knows) = 0.74 (74%)

Evidence Update (Wrong Answer):
P(knows|wrong) = 0.74 × 0.1 / [0.74 × 0.1 + (1-0.74) × (1-0.2)]
P(knows|wrong) = 0.074 / [0.074 + 0.208] = 0.074 / 0.282 = 0.26

Learning Update:
P(knows_final) = 0.26 + (1-0.26) × 0.09 = 0.26 + 0.07 = 0.33
```

**🔀 Fuzzy Logic Enhancement:**
```
Rule: Slow + Wrong + Many Hints → Strong Negative (-0.05)
Adjustment: -0.05
```

**📊 Final Result:**
```
Final Mastery = 0.33 - 0.05 = 0.28 (28%)
```

#### **System Decision Making:**
```
📊 Current Mastery: 28%
🎯 Target for Advancement: 95%
🔄 Action: Continue practice with easier questions
💡 Next Question Difficulty: Level 2 (instead of Level 3)
```

## BKT Mathematical Model

### **Four Key Parameters** (Research-Based Values)

| Parameter | Value | Meaning | Research Source |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **pL0** | 0.3 | Initial knowledge probability | Corbett & Anderson (1995) |
| **pT** | 0.09 | Learning rate per practice | Yudelson et al. (2013) |
| **pS** | 0.1 | Slip probability (error when knowing) | BKT constraint: < 0.1 |
| **pG** | 0.2 | Guess probability (correct when not knowing) | BKT constraint: < 0.3 |

### **Core BKT Formulas**

**Evidence Update (Bayes' Rule):**
```
If CORRECT: P(knows|evidence) = P(knows) × (1-slip) / [P(knows) × (1-slip) + (1-P(knows)) × guess]

If WRONG: P(knows|evidence) = P(knows) × slip / [P(knows) × slip + (1-P(knows)) × (1-guess)]
```

**Learning Update:**
```
P(knows_next) = P(knows|evidence) + (1 - P(knows|evidence)) × learn_rate
```

## Comparison: Traditional vs AI-Enhanced Assessment

### **Traditional System Example:**
```
📊 Student Juan answers 3 questions about Place Value:
✅ Question 1: Correct
❌ Question 2: Wrong  
✅ Question 3: Correct

📈 Traditional Assessment: 2/3 = 67% mastery
🔄 Action: Continue with same difficulty
```

### **MathGaling AI System Example:**
```
📊 Same student, same questions:

✅ Q1: Correct (8 sec, 0 hints) → BKT: 69% + Fuzzy: +5% = 74%
❌ Q2: Wrong (45 sec, 2 hints) → BKT: 33% + Fuzzy: -5% = 28%
✅ Q3: Correct (12 sec, 1 hint) → BKT: 45% + Fuzzy: +2% = 47%

📈 AI Assessment: 47% mastery (more accurate)
🔄 Action: Provide easier questions + targeted remediation
💡 Insight: Student struggles with word problems (Q2 pattern)
```

**🎯 Key Difference:** AI system detected that Juan needs help with word problems specifically, not just more practice.

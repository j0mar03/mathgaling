## 2. PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND LEARNING THEORY

### 2.1 Theoretical Foundation

#### 2.1.1 Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)
The system implements an enhanced BKT model that serves as the core learning analytics engine:

**Standard BKT Parameters:**
- **P(L₀) = 0.3**: Initial knowledge probability (prior knowledge)
- **P(T) = 0.09**: Learning transition probability
- **P(G) = 0.2**: Guess probability when not knowing
- **P(S) = 0.1**: Slip probability when knowing

**Mathematical Model:**
```
Evidence Update (Correct Response):
P(L|correct) = P(L) × (1-P(S)) / [P(L) × (1-P(S)) + (1-P(L)) × P(G)]

Evidence Update (Incorrect Response):
P(L|incorrect) = P(L) × P(S) / [P(L) × P(S) + (1-P(L)) × (1-P(G))]

Learning Update:
P(L_{n+1}) = P(L|evidence) + (1-P(L|evidence)) × P(T)
```

#### 2.1.2 Enhanced BKT with Fuzzy Logic
The system extends traditional BKT with fuzzy logic adjustments that consider:

**Response Time Analysis:**
- Fast correct answers (+0.05 mastery adjustment)
- Slow correct answers (-0.01 adjustment)
- Fast incorrect answers (-0.05 adjustment, indicating carelessness)
- Very slow incorrect answers (-0.015 adjustment, showing effort)

**Interaction Quality Metrics:**
- Hint usage penalties (up to -0.03 per hint)
- Multiple attempt penalties (up to -0.03 per additional attempt)
- Recent performance trends (scaling factors based on recent success rates)

**Multi-Session Mastery Validation:**
- Requires demonstration across multiple learning sessions
- 30-minute session gap threshold for session boundary detection
- High mastery (>0.8) requires either:
  - 3+ consecutive correct answers, OR
  - 70%+ performance across 2+ sessions

### 2.2 Adaptive Learning Mechanisms

#### 2.2.1 Content Selection Algorithm
The system employs a sophisticated content recommendation engine:

```javascript
Content Scoring Algorithm:
1. Base Score = 10
2. Recent Item Penalty = -5 (if seen recently)
3. Difficulty Match Score = -2 × |item_difficulty - target_difficulty|
4. Target Difficulty = ceil(current_mastery × 5)
```

#### 2.2.2 Intervention Strategies
- **Mastery < 0.3**: Beginner interventions with increased scaffolding
- **0.3 ≤ Mastery < 0.7**: Intermediate practice with targeted exercises
- **Mastery ≥ 0.7**: Advanced challenges and enrichment content

#### 2.2.3 Learning Path Optimization

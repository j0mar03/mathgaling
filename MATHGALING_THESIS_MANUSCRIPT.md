## 1. Introduction

The Philippine educational system faces significant challenges in mathematics education, particularly at the elementary level. The 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) revealed that Filipino students ranked last among 58 participating countries in Grade 4 mathematics achievement [1]. This performance gap highlights the urgent need for innovative educational technologies that can provide personalized support to learners while assisting teachers in managing diverse classroom needs.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have emerged as a promising solution for addressing individual learning differences through adaptive instruction and continuous assessment [2]. However, most existing ITS platforms are designed for Western educational contexts and may not adequately address the specific needs of Philippine learners, including cultural considerations, curriculum alignment, and resource constraints.

This research presents MathGaling, an ITS specifically designed for Philippine Grade 3-4 mathematics education. The name combines "Math" with the Filipino word "Galing" (meaning excellence or skill), reflecting the system's goal of fostering mathematical excellence while maintaining cultural relevance. The system addresses three key research questions:

1. How can Bayesian Knowledge Tracing be effectively implemented to track and predict student mastery in elementary mathematics?
2. What mastery threshold optimally balances learning progression with knowledge retention in the Philippine educational context?
3. How can a multi-stakeholder approach (student, teacher, parent, administrator) enhance the effectiveness of an ITS?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Intelligent Tutoring Systems in Mathematics Education

Intelligent Tutoring Systems have demonstrated significant effectiveness in mathematics education. VanLehn's meta-analysis [3] found that ITS produced learning gains with an effect size of 0.76 standard deviations compared to traditional classroom instruction. Specific to elementary mathematics, systems like Carnegie Learning's MATHia and Khan Academy have shown improvements in student achievement ranging from 15-25% [4].

### 2.2 Bayesian Knowledge Tracing

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, introduced by Corbett and Anderson [5], provides a probabilistic framework for modeling student knowledge states. The algorithm uses four parameters:
- P(L₀): Initial probability of knowledge
- P(T): Probability of learning from practice
- P(G): Probability of correct response when skill is not known (guess)
- P(S): Probability of incorrect response when skill is known (slip)

Recent advances in BKT implementation have shown optimal performance with mastery thresholds between 90-95% [6], though specific threshold selection remains context-dependent.

### 2.3 Cultural Considerations in Educational Technology

Bernardo et al. [7] identified unique characteristics of Filipino learners, including high collectivism, emphasis on social relationships, and the concept of "kapwa" (shared identity). These cultural factors suggest that educational technologies for Philippine contexts should incorporate collaborative elements and family involvement.

### 2.4 Technology Acceptance in Philippine Education

Studies on technology adoption in Philippine schools reveal that perceived usefulness and ease of use remain primary factors influencing teacher adoption [8]. Additionally, infrastructure limitations and varying levels of digital literacy necessitate systems that are lightweight, mobile-responsive, and intuitive.

## 3. System Design and Architecture

### 3.1 Overall Architecture

MathGaling employs a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React-based single-page application with responsive design
2. **Application Layer**: Express.js server implementing RESTful APIs and business logic
3. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM for data persistence

The system is deployed using Netlify's serverless architecture with Supabase for database hosting, ensuring scalability and minimal infrastructure requirements.

### 3.2 User Roles and Interfaces

#### 3.2.1 Student Interface
- Personalized dashboard with learning recommendations
- Adaptive quiz system with immediate feedback
- Progress visualization using gamification elements
- Theme customization for engagement

#### 3.2.2 Teacher Interface
- Classroom management and student enrollment
- Real-time performance analytics
- Intervention dashboard highlighting at-risk students
- Content creation and curation tools

#### 3.2.3 Parent Interface
- Child progress monitoring
- Weekly performance reports
- Direct communication with teachers

#### 3.2.4 Administrator Interface
- User management across all roles
- Content approval workflow
- System-wide analytics and reporting

### 3.3 Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Implementation

The BKT algorithm implementation tracks student mastery for each Knowledge Component (KC) through the following process:

```
P(L[n+1]) = P(L[n]) + (1 - P(L[n])) × P(T)
```

Where:
- P(L[n]) = probability of knowing the skill at opportunity n
- P(T) = probability of learning the skill from practice

The system updates mastery probabilities after each student response, considering:
- Correct response: Increases mastery probability
- Incorrect response: Decreases mastery probability
- Response time: Factored into confidence calculations

### 3.4 Mastery Threshold Justification

Based on extensive literature review and empirical evidence, MathGaling implements a 95% mastery threshold for KC progression. This threshold is supported by:

1. **Cognitive Load Theory**: 95% accuracy ensures automaticity, freeing working memory [9]
2. **Retention Studies**: 34% better long-term retention compared to 80% threshold [10]
3. **Transfer Learning**: 41% improved performance on novel problems [11]
4. **Philippine Context**: Aligns with DepEd's mastery-based progression goals

### 3.5 Content Organization

The system organizes content hierarchically:
- **Knowledge Components (KCs)**: High-level topics aligned with DepEd curriculum
- **Content Items**: Individual questions and exercises
- **Difficulty Levels**: 5-tier system based on Bloom's taxonomy
- **Question Types**: Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, word problems

## 4. Implementation Details
